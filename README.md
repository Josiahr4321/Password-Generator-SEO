# Password-Generator-SEO

In this challenge I added code to create a proper password generator.

Created an alert that tells the user that when they sign it they must choose the the selected length of their password from 8-128 characters.

Created a totalString variable with "if" statements below it.

The "if" statements were actually questions to  ask the user if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters in their password.

Used the "+=" operator to add and combine the following characters to the password.

When you do not follow the alerts given you will be told to please try again.

Created a "for" loop that actually carries a "Math.floor" and "Math.random" tag.

The "Math.floor" tag returns the number rounded down to the nearest integer.

The "Math.random" tag chooses random numbers and characters.

Created a function that writes the password the user desired.
